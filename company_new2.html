                <p>Hotjar is a successful, self-funded/bootstrapped, start-up that operates on a fully remote basis, and with an emphasis on personal development.</p>
                <p1>Spread throughout Europe, the Americas, and Africa, our team casts a wide net across a multitude of locations, lifestyles, and backgrounds. It’s our<p1><br>
                <p1>differences that make us interesting, and our shared belief in Hotjar’s Core Values that bind us together.</p1>
                <p>Hotjar's culture is guided by respect, transparency, collaboration, and direct feedback. </p>
                <p>Hotjar pledges to be a harassment-free and discrimination-free company. </p>
                <p1>We believe people from different backgrounds, with different identities and experiences, make our product, and our company, better – just as our users come from<p1><br>
                <p1> everywhere, a diverse team helps ensure we create a product that is accessible to a wide range of people. </p1><br><br>
                <p1>We're obsessed with communicating with our users as well as within the team. We hate bureaucracy and slow-moving organizations – but we're suckers for well-defined<p1><br>
                 <p1>processes. We love lean, iterative improvements, and success is measured by the value we create for our users.</p1>
