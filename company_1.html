                <p>Founded in 2014, we are proud to be a self-funded, profitable, and fully distributed company on a mission to help you better understand how users behave on your website.</p>
                <p>We serve customers in 180+ countries and work with the best people around the world: our global team of over 100 Hotjarians works remotely throughout Europe, the Americas, and Africa. Hi ðŸ‘‹</p>

                <h1>What we do</h1>
                <p1>We help you better understand user behavior so you can make the right changes, improve UX, and grow conversions.</p1>
                <p>We began in 2014, when we released a simple beta version of Hotjar, collected feedback from hundreds of testers (we consider them our â€˜Founding Membersâ€™), and kept improving through iterative changes.</p>
                <p>Six years on, Hotjar is the leading solution for businesses selling online and their marketing, analytics, UX, and CRO teams who want a clearer understanding of user behavior. Our team of 100+ Hotjarians is committed to making Hotjar easyâ€”easy to get approval for, set up, use, and get valuable insights from.</p>
                <p>We are used on over 550k websites in 180+ countries, but we havenâ€™t forgotten our beginnings: our origin story is publicly and transparently documented, and you can read it here.</p>

                <h1>Our values</h1>
                <p1>We want to build a long-lasting, sustainable, and purposeful business with engaged team members and delighted customers.</p1>
                <p>From day one, Hotjar embraced a remote and flexible working environment. We work a 40-hour week but are empowered to plan our time and productivity as we wish. We have budgets to set up our home office, personal development and wellness allowances, and a â€˜work togetherâ€™ budget to visit other Hotjarians, wherever they may beâ€”among other perks.</p>
                <p>We don't see each other in person often, but our work is always guided by respect, transparency, and collaboration. Our success is measured by the value we create for our users and customers, and all 100+ of us aim to follow five core values:</p>
                <p2>1. Obsess over our users</p2><br>
                <p2>2. Be bold and move fast</p2><br>
                <p2>3. Work with resp2ect</p2><br>
                <p2>4. Build trust with transarency</p2><br>
                <p2>5. Learn by doing</p2><br>
                <p>The way we work is publicly documented, and you can read our team manual here.</p>
